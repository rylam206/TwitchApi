# CSE 163 Final Project: Tracking Streaming Data

_Instructions to How to Run Project_:
1. Make sure you have all necessary files:
    * main.py
    * twitch.py
    * Download folder containing shroud Data: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0ugahv4q6d21fef/AACqVlUhCxX2h2AXhuqoqveba?dl=0
        * Make sure the **folder** is in the same directory as main.py and twitch.py
1. Running the main method in the module main.py should
reproduce our results in our research questions.**
1. There should be 6 png files and 2 dot files produced. aceu.png, shroud.png, and sykkuno.png are for research question on viewership growth by Valorant.
male_vs_female.png is for research question on comparing male and female streamers. viewership_growth and subscription_growth (accompanied by their dot files)
are graphs for predicting streamer growth.
1. For both Machine Learning functions. To visualize the DecisionTree regressor graphs (views.dot & followers.dot) you need to
   download and open the .dot files with Visual Studio Code. Then you would want to add Graphiz(dot) extension(second option).
   Finally, you click the ... on the top right and click "Open Preview to Side". From there you would be able to see the graph.


**Note: As of 3/16/21 15:30 PST, Viewership Data for Twitch streamers aceu, Sykkuno,
and Shroud has been scraped from Twitch and may not reflect current data.
